# 1. The Process

<p>
The process of the project is separated into three main parts, and more details for each section are already provided in the table above.  "Although social media are believed to help to connect people, it can also be a cause of loneliness and depression in teenagers." is the brief I proposed and is the direction I used to craft the content throughout the project. 
</p>
<p>
In part 1, I explore the story arch or the overall structure of the data visualization, did research on the available dataset on my domain, and did initial sketches for my wireframe.

<p>
In the second part, all the rough sketches in the previous phase were recreated into a digital version.  The user testing was conducted using those digital mockups, and the design was improved utilizing the results of the user testing.

<p>
In this part, I moved on developing and finalizing the data visualization artifacts as well as the overall content on an online platform called Shorthand.

# 2. The Data Source

<p>
In the final data visualization, there are multiple data sources and information references about social networks and depression that I utilized in the project as follows.

1. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, Twenge et al.<br>

# 3. The Target Audience
<p>
This project targets those without a background in statistics or data, so the tone of the story will be more narrative and easy to read for anyone. In terms of lifestyle, it targets social media users as this can be directly related to them or their family members. It does not only help introduce them to the alarming issues which happen with teenagers, but it also helps them observe their behaviors if they tend to experience depression from their social media usage.
</p>
<p>
In order to engage this group of audience, I try to simplify charts or graphs used by only emphasizing the related information.  I used descriptive languages and contextual icons (rather than only numbers and texts), so it is skimmable and easy to understand by anyone.  Moreover, infographic is used in some data visualization to make the context more interesting.
