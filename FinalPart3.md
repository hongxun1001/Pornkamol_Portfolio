# 1. The process

<p>
The process of the project is seperated into 3 main parts and more details for each part is already provided in the table above.  "Despite social media are believed to help connecting people together, it can also be a cause of loneliness and depression in teenagers." is the brief I proposed and is the direction I used to craft the content throughout the project.  
</p>
<p>
In the part 1, I explore the story arch or the overall straucture of the datavisualization, did a research on the avaiable dataset on my domain and did an initail sketches for my wireframe.
</p>

<p>
In the second part, all the rough sketches in the previous phase were re created into a digital version.  The user testing was conducted using those digital mockups and the design was improved utilizing the results of the user testing.

<p>
In this part, I moved on developing and finalizing the data visualization artifacts as well as the overll content on an online platform called Shorthand.
