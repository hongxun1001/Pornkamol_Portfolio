# The data

### The data I chose

<p>
The data visualisation I chose is in the passage about “How many people die and how many are born each year?” Which is published by Our world in data.
https://ourworldindata.org/births-and-deaths
</p>

<p>
Two charts that I focus on are the line graphs about the Number of birth per year (World) and the Number of death per year (World). I chose these visualizations because I can see rooms for development, and the insight convey from these graphs can bring about several opportunities and understandings.  For instance, what social trends might emerge from the change in birth and death rate or what we could prepare for the less growth rate in global populations etc.

### What I want to improve

<p>
From the rationales I discussed, the significant issues are about how efficient the graph can convey the insight about the impact of these births and deaths rate. However, the context or the media these graphs are published may be the reason why the designer has designed the graph this way. For example, the aim of the website may be to purely provide no or minimal interpretation and to avoid bias. To me, I would like to highlight this insight and make the graph easier to interpret for the mass.

# Ideation and Wireframe

### The context

<p>The key insight is about the overall growth in population, which derives from the difference in the number of births and deaths in each year. The existing location of the graph on the screen makes it difficult to compare the number of births and deaths because the audiences cannot see both figures at the same time or in one screenshot (Both in the computer screens or mobile devices). Scrolling back and forth is also troublesome. Therefore, I decided to design a new graph which combines information about births and deaths. This way, users will be able to compare the information within one screenshot in which the chart is published among the text.

### The graph sketches

<p>I used Tableau to draft the mockup and Adobe Illustrator to make some adjustments to my mockup (sketches). The two concepts I created are one with an additional line for “difference” (Yellow line) and another one with shading to help emphasizing the differences in the areas.
