# About Me
I am Pornkamol Prapapornvorakul. What a long Thai name!  Fah is my nickname so you might call me by "Fah".

I'm pursuing my Master's degree in Integrated Innovation for Products and Services at Carnegie Mellon University, with the passion for utilizing 'design' extensively in diverse industries and delivering real and attainable values to the people as well as to the society.

I have a bachelor's degree in industrial design, with an emphasis on human-centered design, and working experiences in a fin-tech industry as a UX/UI designer.  My hobby is doodling and note-taking in a fun way!

# What I hope to learn
My work as a UX researcher requires a lot of presentation which should well illustrate the data in an easy but interesting way.  Information related to design can be complex by its nature since understanding users' behaviors and their thoughts might not be simple.  I love to create diagrams but sometimes I question if I have put too much data or how well it can convey meanings.  I hope to gain some new ideas for data visualization and reflect on my own works.
